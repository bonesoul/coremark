Codename Coremark, is a next generation benchmarking software for x86 based computers.
It's intented to benchmark your system as whole or within parts. Coremark is completely
from any benchmark software. Up to know, usual benchmarking software has been always built
on a commonly-used operating system like Windows, Linux etc. 

So the other benchmarking software always relies on these commonly-used operating systems.
These operating systems are designed for general use. While benchmarking these general-design
operating systems can effect the benchmarking process or even user input while benchmarking
can effect the process. This equals non-efficient benchmarks and scores changing from
benchmark to benchmark.

On the otherside, Coremark, utilizes it's own bultin kernel. The kernel residing under the
Coremark, is specificly designed for benchmarking process.
